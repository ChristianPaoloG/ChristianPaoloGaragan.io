          <h3>Design and Development(Website and Applications)</h3>
          <p>During secondary school, I grew increasingly curious about games and how they were made. I then decided to start learning how to code so that I would be able to make my own games. As I learned and discovered different languages, I also discovered different types of developing other than game design, such as web and mobile developing. </p>

          <h3>Electronics Engineering</h3>
          <p>I don't just deal with software, I deal with hardware too! From Arduino to Raspberry Pi, you name it and I will most likely have tinkered with it! I have also design a few PCBs for my own use in my projects. Check them out on my <a class="gallery" href="">blog</a>!</p>
